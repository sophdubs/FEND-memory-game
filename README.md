# Memory Game Project
Mordern spin on the classic memory card game. 


## The Board
The game board consists of a 4 X 4 grid of "cards". The deck is comprised of 8 pairs of cards which are shuffled and placed face down on the board.


## Game Rules
-The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.  
-The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.  
-If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.  
-If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.  
-The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.  


## Star Rating
-The player earns 3 stars if he/she plays a perfect game (matches all 16 cards in 16 moves).    
-The player earns 2 stars if he/she matches all 16 cards in 17 to 30 moves.   
-The player earns 1 star if he/she matches all 16 cards in over 30 moves.
