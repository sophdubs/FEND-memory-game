# Memory Game Project
Mordern spin on the classic memory card game. 


## The Board
The game board consists of a 4 X 4 grid of "cards". The deck is comprised of 8 pairs of cards which are shuffled and placed face down on the board.


## Game Rules
-The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
-The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
-If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
-If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
-The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
